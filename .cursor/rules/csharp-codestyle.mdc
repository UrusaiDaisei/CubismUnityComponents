# Language-Specific Guidelines

## C# Guidelines
- Use PascalCase for class names, public properties, and methods;
- Use camelCase for private fields (prefix with _);
- Private static field names should be prefixed with "s_";
- Use `readonly` where applicable;
- Prefer expression-bodied members for simple methods;
- Use uppercase snake_case for class level constants;
- Classes should always be sealed by default;
- Always prefer the `var` type for local variables, instead explicit variable types;
- Each region start/end should have a whiteline space between it, the code;
