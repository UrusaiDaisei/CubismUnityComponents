# Language-Specific Guidelines

## C# Guidelines
- Use PascalCase for class names, public properties, and methods
- Use camelCase for private fields (prefix with _)
- Use `readonly` where applicable
- Prefer expression-bodied members for simple methods
- Use uppercase snake_case for class level constants
- Classes should always be sealed by default
- Each region start/end should have a whiteline space between it, the code
- Slways prefer the `var` type for local variables, instead explicit variable types
