- avoid removing comments and anotations unless explicitly requested by the developers.
    - Comments can still be moved around or rewritten slightly if deemed appropriate, as long as the base context and meaning for the comment doesn't change much.
    - You can suggest the removal of comments, if you think they are no longer relevant. But always ask permission first.
